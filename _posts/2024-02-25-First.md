title: SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
subtitle: A Logistic Regression Project

---
## Project Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. Sonar signals can be used for various applications, and in this case, we aim to distinguish underwater objects as rocks or mines.

## Data
The dataset used for this project contains a collection of sonar signals and their corresponding labels. Each data point represents a sonar signal, and the label indicates whether it’s a rock (R) or a mine (M).

## Data Attributes:
Feature1, Feature2, …, Feature60: Numerical features extracted from sonar signals.
Label (Target Variable): R (Rock) or M (Mine)

## Model Selection:
Logistic regression was chosen as the model for this project due to its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle binary classification tasks. However, other models such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines could also be explored for comparison.

## Model Evaluation:
In addition to accuracy, additional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are included to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. These metrics help to evaluate the model's ability to correctly classify rocks and mines and identify any potential areas for improvement.

## Conclusion:
The logistic regression model achieves a high accuracy score on both the training and testing data, indicating good generalization. However, there are limitations to the model, such as the small size of the dataset and the simplicity of the model. Future work could involve collecting more data, exploring other machine learning models, and improving the model's performance.
